Talks about semantic HTML in my experience and gives a general idea of how to use it.

- What it is
  - Using tags that make sense
- Why it's good
  - CSS selection
  - SEO (no one cares)
  - Looks clean
- How to do it
  - Examples of different formats of HTML
  - Article example
  - Home page example
  - CSS examples
- Possible pitfalls
  - Semantic HTML for styling (H1-6 for font size)
  - Semantics for similarly styled tags (i, b, ruby, ul/ol swap)
- More resources
